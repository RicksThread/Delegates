# Delegates
Delegates in C# are a very powerful tool in making programs as they can handle pointers to functions, member functions and lambdas. They can be used as events (E.I: You've just won a game) and invoked to call all of the methods that they reference. Since C++ doesn't have any native application I decided to try and create my own version of it (for learning purposes)
